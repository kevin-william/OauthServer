## OAuth Server in C#

This repository provides a lightweight OAuth 2.0 authorization server implemented in C#. 

### Getting Started

This server is designed for development purposes and demonstrates core functionalities. Here's what you'll need:

* **.NET Framework 4.5 or later**
* **Visual Studio 2017 or later**

### Project Setup

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.**
3. **Install the required NuGet package:**
   ```bash
   Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens

### Running the Server

1. Update configuration details in Startup.cs (client ID, secret, etc.).
2. Run the project (F5).
3. The server typically listens on http://localhost:44360 by default (port might vary).

### Functionality

This server implements the Authorization Code Grant flow:

* Clients request access tokens by sending a POST request to the /token endpoint.
* The server validates the client and responds with a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing access claims.

#### Important Note:

* In this example, we've enabled insecure communication (HTTP) for development purposes. Always use HTTPS for secure communication in production.

### Using the Server with a Client Application

A separate client application is required to interact with this server. You can develop your client application using any framework or language that supports OAuth 2.0.

This repository doesn't include a client application example, but the general steps would involve:

1. Configure the client application with your server's details (token endpoint, client ID, secret).
2. The client redirects the user to the server's authorization endpoint.
3. The user grants access, and the server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.
4. The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the server's token endpoint.
5.The client uses the access token to access protected resources on the resource server.

### Further Considerations

This is a basic implementation and lacks features like user management, refresh tokens, and secure storage of secrets. You'll need to extend this code for production use based on your specific requirements.
